For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will offer users a simple analysis of relevant astrological data that derives from their birthdate information. It will familiarize users with their personal astrological information, and provide briefs on what specific placements mean for them. The project may provide users a simpler understanding of astrology, hopefully making their own conversations about the topic a bit more informed, and their connection with the world a bit more profound.
