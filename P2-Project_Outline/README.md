## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will give users a general understanding of astrology, if they don't already have one. It will familiarize users with their very own astrological information, and provide briefs on what each placement means for them. My project may provide users more insight into astrology, hopefully making their own conversations about the topic a bit more informed.
